# SignifySage - Sign Language Gesture Recognition

SignifySage is an innovative system designed to empower the deaf community by accurately recognizing and interpreting sign language gestures. This project combines a user-friendly React frontend with a Flask-based backend, featuring a custom-made Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.

## Key Features

- **Effortless Communication**: SignifySage facilitates seamless communication between the hearing-impaired and others through precise sign language gesture recognition.

- **Custom CNN Model**: We've developed a robust CNN model tailored for accurate sign language recognition, ensuring reliable results.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The React-based frontend provides an intuitive user experience, making it accessible to both experts and newcomers.

## Dataset

Our project is built upon a meticulously collected and curated dataset of sign language gestures. This dataset ensures the model's proficiency and reliability in interpreting a wide range of gestures.

## Model Access

You can access the trained CNN model on [Google Drive](link-to-model-on-google-drive). Make sure to follow the instructions in the README to use the model effectively.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.

2. Install dependencies for both the frontend and backend using `npm install` and `pip install -r requirements.txt`, respectively.

3. Run the frontend and backend servers.

4. Access the application via your browser.

## Usage

1. Access the sign language gesture recognition feature.

2. Perform a sign language gesture in front of your camera, and let SignifySage translate it into text.
